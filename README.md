### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'M EZEMA ANTHONY SUNDAY

**I'M FULL-STACK SOFTWARE DEVELOPER STUDENT**
 
I'M ANTHONY FROM NIGERIA, I AM A STUDENT AT MICROVERSE, A REMOTE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT USES PAIR PROGRAMMING AND PROJECT BUILDING TO TEACH DEVELOPMENT IN A MULTICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT AND SHOW YOU THE ROAD MAP TO BECOMING A SEASONED DEVELOPER THROUGH PAIR PROGRAMMING. I LOVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE REALITY FROM AN IDEA THAT CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. CREATIVITY IS NOT MY ONLY PASSION, I ALSO LOVE FOOTBALL, TRAVELLING, AND HANGING OUT WITH FRIENDS. I HOPE TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE IN WITH THE SKILLS I AQUIRE.
